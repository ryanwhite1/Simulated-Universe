### Stellar Objects in this image
**Note:** positive radial velocities indicated objects moving away from us.
Blue flux is measured at 440nm, green at 500nm, and red at 700nm.
Units are:

 Measurement | Unit 
--- | ---
 Position | degrees
 Flux | W/nm/m^2^
 Parallax | arcsec
 Radial Velocity | km/s
 Variable | unitless (=1 if variable, =0 if not)

Uncertainties in this data (one standard deviation figures) are:

 Measurement | Uncertainty 
--- | ---
 Flux | 1%
 Position | 0.0001 degrees
 Parallax | 0.001 arcseconds
 Radial Velocity | 0.03km/s
