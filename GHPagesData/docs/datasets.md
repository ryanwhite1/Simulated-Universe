# Datasets!

Here are some datasets to download and analyse (in .zip format). 

 - Seed 6604: [Web](Datasets/universe_6604/datasetMain.md);   [Zip](Datasets/universe_6604.zip) (Difficult)
 
## How to Access and Use the Data
The first step in analysing the data is to get the data! Download one of the .zip files from above according to the difficulty of your choice and unzip it in a directory you'd like to work in, or go through the pages to manually download each dataset. 
Upon unzipping the file, you will see these files, or files similar to this (some might be missing):

`Universe Image.png` is a visual image of all of the objects in the universe, taken with a mock telescope. Take a look at this first!
Next, I'd recommend taking a look at `Radio Overlay Image.png` (if it's in your dataset!). This is the same as `Universe Image.png`, just with some overlaid data pertaining to what you'd see in the radio spectrum. Even with just these two images, you can start qualitatively inferring properties about your universe!

## If you'd like to generate your own data...
Follow the instructions in the github repository README.
